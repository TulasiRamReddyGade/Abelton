                    Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and
                    learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly

                    We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The

                    We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and
                    many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide
                    range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us
                    have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are
                    somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief
                    that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute
                    to something big: helping to shape the future of music
                    culture.
